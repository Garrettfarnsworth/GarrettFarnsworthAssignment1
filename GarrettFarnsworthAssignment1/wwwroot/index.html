            <h3>My name is Garrett Farnsworth, but you can just call me Garrett!</h3>
            <h3>Learning Goals:</h3>
            <p>
                I hope to be able to learn a lot about various aspects of Enterprise Application Development from this class
                since I don't feel like I know much about it. I want to find out which parts I like and want to pursue in the future
                and vice versa. A big part of this class that I am excited about is getting familiar with Visual Studio as I havne't
                used it previous to this class. I am also excited to delve into APT.net, potentially React, and getting more comfortable
                with GitHub repositories. I ultimatley hope to find things within this subject material that I want to pursue on my own
                time and fuel my passion for learning these kinds of difficult subjects.
            </p>
